### **Interface Concepts**


##### 1. AA meetings:

- [This](https://github.com/aaditirokade/data-structures/blob/master/weekly_assignment11/UIconceptAAmeetings.png) is what the visualization should look like. 
- Data mapping: Considering the filter (from assumptions)the meetings that meet the criteria should show on the map- mapped based on the latitude, longitude by using circles (with radius equivalent to the number of meetings) and grouped by location.
  (optional: depending on AM-PM selection meetings should be filtered further)
- Default view: map with all weekend meetings
- Assumptions: User wants to know only meetings that happen over the weekend

##### 2. Dear Diary:

- [This](https://github.com/aaditirokade/data-structures/blob/master/weekly_assignment11/UIconceptDeardiary.png) is what the visualization should look like. 
- Data mapping: Overall game performance section should show colored blocks equivalent to games won/lost/folded till date.
  Similarly, "No. pf people I talked to" & "Water Consumption" sections display blocks but only for last 3 days.
- Assumptions: User is interested in knowing data on "No. pf people I talked to" & "Water Consumption" only for last 3 days.


##### 3. Sensor:

- [This](https://github.com/aaditirokade/data-structures/blob/master/weekly_assignment11/UIconceptSensor.png) is what the visualization should look like. 
- Data mapping: 8 hrs (in minutes mapped to big circle), small circle represents "wake" time (from hearing 1st alarm to actualing getting up)
  (optional: provide a wave of recorded digital values for last two days)
- Assumptions: Sensor was tilted every time the alarm buzzed and was registered.
