### **Weekly Assignment 5 : Documentation**

#### Part1

1. The [data model](https://github.com/aaditirokade/data-structures/blob/master/Weekly_assignment5/Part1_dataModel.png) was created in Adobe Illustrator.

2. After observing the data model I realised that the table entries for certain can get repetative for certain rows. This is a denormalized data model. When a data comes out of the database, it might be contained in a JSON format file but in terms of the structure, it will not be a strict tabular format but more of grouping of the *key: value* pairs depending upon the usecases. I do not see a harsh hierarchy but a list of *key:value* pairs arranged inside a table.


#### Part2

The [js code](https://github.com/aaditirokade/data-structures/blob/master/Weekly_assignment5/index_part2.js) was written as per the instructions for [Assignment5](https://github.com/visualizedata/data-structures/blob/master/assignments/weekly_assignment_05.md)

#### Part3

The [js code](https://github.com/aaditirokade/data-structures/blob/master/Weekly_assignment5/index_part3.js) was written as per the instructions with an addition of async.eachSeries to add all the values to the database.
